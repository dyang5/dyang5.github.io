Iâ€™m a senior at Swarthmore College studying Mathematics and Computer Science on the Honors track. I'm interested in pursuing a career in academia and am planning to apply to graduate programs this fall. 

At Swarthmore, I lead the Interactive Math Colloquium committee, code as part of the ICPC team, write sports articles for The Phoenix, and work for both the Math & CS departments.
