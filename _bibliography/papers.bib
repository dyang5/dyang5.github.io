      abstract={We introduce a new class of fractal circle packings in the
plane, generalizing the polyhedral packings defined by Kontorovich and
Nakamura. The existence and uniqueness of these packings are guaranteed by infinite versions of the Koebe-Andreev-Thurston theorem. We
prove structure theorems giving a complete description of the symmetry
groups for these packings. And we give several examples to illustrate
their number-theoretic and group-theoretic significance.},
