    - title: REU-CAAR (Combinatorics, Algorithms, and AI for Real Problems)
      institution: <i>Researcher at University of Maryland, College Park (Fairness in Diffusion Models)</i>
      year: Summer 2023
      description:
        - Worked on improving fairness and general representation (of gender and race characteristics) in text-to-image generative AI models. 
        - Applied "Semantic Guidance" approach to modify gender and race embeddings by guiding the concepts in embedding space, yielding more representative gender and race output.}

      institution: <i>Math Researcher (Circle Packings from Tilings of the Plane)</i>
      year: Summer 2022
      description:
        - Analyzed properties of five limit circle packings from tilings of the plane, including integrality/superintegrality and commensurability to known polyhedra. Found first known superintegral packing that is non-commensurable to any polyhedra.
        - Advised by Professor Ian Whitehead at Swarthmore College and paper submitted to Journal of Geometry.
    - title: Swarthmore College
      institution: <i>Math Researcher (Exploring Projective SET)</i>
      year: Summer 2021
      description:
        - Used Linear and Abstract Algebra to classify and discover the properties of the algebraic space of projective SET. Calculated the number of projective sets of a certain size and the probability a set is achieved in a deal of cards using the Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem and counting techniques. 
        - Advised by Professor Lucas Van Meter and Professor Cathy Hsu at Swarthmore College.
