<h1 class="post-title">Interactive Math Colloquium Club</h1>

The Interactive Math Colloquium Club is an extension of Swarthmore College's <a href = "https://www.swarthmore.edu/mathematics-statistics/colloquia-general-information">Math Department Colloquium Talks</a> that hopes to bring mathematics to the greater Swarthmore community. The talks are by nature more interactive than the department-hosted talks and are organized by students rather than the department. I have been a leader and organizer for the club since Fall 2022 and act as a board member alongside Zhengfei Li and Mengyuan Yang.


## Spring 2023 Talks
  <details>
    <summary><b>Professor Steve Wang (April 4th, 2023)</b>: <i>How Many Right Whales are Left on Earth? And How Do We Know?</i></summary>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px"><b>Abstract</b>: The North Atlantic right whale is one of the most endangered whale species in the world, pushed to the brink of extinction by centuries of human hunting. Although legal whaling of the species was ended in 1935, these whales remain threatened by entanglement in fishing gear and collisions with ships. As a result, the population has been slow to rebound. I will discuss my research on how many North Atlantic right whales are left in the oceans.</p>

  <details><summary><b>Professor Pat Devlin (February 7th, 2023)</b>: <i>Interactive Proofs: How to Share a Secret Without Giving It Away</i></summary>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px"><b>Abstract</b>: A big company wants somebody to solve a difficult problem, and they’re offering a lot of money to anybody who can tell them the solution. And luckily, you know exactly how to solve it! But unfortunately you don’t trust the company, and they don’t trust you. They won’t pay you any money until they’re SURE you know how to solve their problem, but you don’t want to tell them your solution until they’ve given you the money first. How can you convince them that you know what the solution is without giving them any hints about what the solution actually is? In this talk, we discuss this problem—among others—as part of a fascinating area of math called interactive proofs (in particular zero-knowledge proofs). This talk will be accessible to anybody, and I’ll also include some questions for ongoing research.</p>

## Fall 2022 Talks
 <details>
    <summary><b>Professor Lynne Schofield (November 1st, 2022)</b>: <i>How a Statistican Studies Response Time to Measure Cognition and Cognitive Decline</i></summary>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px"><b>Abstract</b>: The world is being digitized and moved from paper and pencil to electronic systems (e.g., in medical records, educational testing, and the collection of survey data.) This talk will argue that a wealth of information exists in the metadata recorded as a byproduct of electronic data collection. In particular, adequate measures of cognitive function have been unavailable in many research datasets examining older adults at risk for Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias. I will show how my colleagues and I developed a measure of response times (RT), the time it takes older adults to answer items on a widely-used clinical measure, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Then I will show how we use that measure of RT to predict concurrent and future MoCA scores.  We also test RT for predictive validity (or the ability of RT to measure other things related to MoCA scores).  RT are particularly useful for individuals with mild cognitive impairment, a part of the cognition distribution where errors are meaningful and problematic. RT may increase the accuracy of cognitive assessments without increasing the time it takes to administer the assessment. Our results have implications for clinicians who may be able to use the response time data to supplement the cognitive score and to better understand current cognitive performance and later cognitive decline.</p>

    <summary><b>Professor Teddy Einstein (October 4th, 2022)</b>: <i>The Word Problem in Group Theory</i></summary>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px"><b>Abstract</b>: Groups are algebraic structures that can be defined with a presentation of generators and relators. Each group element can be described as a "word" using an alphabet consisting of generators and their inverses. Two words represent the same group element if they differ by a product of (conjugates of) relators. The word problem asks if it is always possible to decide whether two words represent the same group element. In this talk, I will give a brief history of the word problem, explain how to think about the word problem geometrically, and discuss some of the amazing consequences of work that has been done on the word problem.</p>

    <summary><b>Professor Janet Talvacchia (September 20th, 2022)</b>: <i>Geometry and Spaces</i></summary>
